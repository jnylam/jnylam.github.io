## Part 1 (programming): practice recursion on CodingBat

### How to get started

(skip if you have already done it for Homework 1)

1. Create an account on [codingbat.com](//codingbat.com).
2. Under __Prefs__, scroll down the page and enter the teacher's email account: __jnylam@gmail.com__. This is how the professor will be able to see your progress and give you credit. So you don't need to submit anything for this part of the homework. Just solve the problems.

### Tips

(reminders from Homework 1)

Tip #1: don't solve all the problems in one sitting. Wait a day or two and then come back for more. Studies have shown that spaced practice is better for long-term memory than drill practice.

Tip #2: it's tempting, especially when you can get immediate feedback on whether you got it right, to keep fixing your solution until all tests pass. This is bad programming and won't help you during exams and coding interviews. Instead, be thoughtful about how you are going about solving the problem, and try to solve the problems in the fewest number of attempts.

### The actual assignment

Solve all __Recursion-2__ problems.

## Part 2 (written): review proof by induction

### Problem

master theorem

divide-and-conquer: closest pairs

divide-and-conquer: Karatsuba
write out the pseudcode for Karatsuba (3 multiplications) and with 4 multiplications

backtracking problems

making change


### Problem

### Submission

Solutions should be turned in on Canvas as a __single PDF file__. Here are some options for how to do this:

You have the option of handwriting your solutions on paper, scanning them, and converting them to PDF. Please do not send the images.

You also have the option of typing your solutions up in your favorite word processor. Export or print your document as a PDF file and submit that. Please do not a submit .docx file.

Finally, you have the option of preparing a professional-looking document using LaTeX. This is what authors use to write textbooks and research papers. If you choose this option, here are some pointers to get you started.

* [Getting LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
* [LaTeX homework template](http://www.jennylam.cc/assets/template.zip): this is a good place to start learning LaTeX. Feel free to modify this document as you need.
* [Any of the many good LaTeX tutorials/cheatsheets/beginner's guides online](https://lmddgtfy.net/?q=Latex%20quickstart).


## Rubric

This assignment is worth 20 points:

* 5 points for reasonable attempt on 10 programming problems from Recursion-1.
* 5 points (0.5 per problem) for correctly solved programming problems.
* 6 points for reasonable attempt on all 7  written problems. This means all answers must be justified. Getting the "right answer" doesn't count without a reasonable explanation as to how you got it. The solutions must be entirely written by yourself (that is, no copying).
* 4 points for correctness on 2 of the written problems, randomly chosen by the grader.

Warmup: You can submit the warmup problems for feedback as well, but those won't count towards the grade. Those are meant as easier practice problems if you are having trouble with the main problems.

Bonus: 0.5 point extra credit for each additional Recursion-1 problem towards homework recorded at the end of the semester. So you can keep coming back before each exam and practice some more. The last day to get points for this will be on the day before the final exam.
