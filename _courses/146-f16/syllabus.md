## Course Description

Implementations of advanced tree structures, priority queues, heaps, directed and undirected graphs. Advanced searching and sorting (radix sort, heapsort, mergesort, and quicksort). Design and analysis of data structures and algorithms. Divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming algorithm design techniques.

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLO)

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the implementation of lists, stacks, queues, search trees, heaps, union-find ADT, and graphs and be able to use these data structures in programs they design
2. Prove basic properties of trees and graphs
3. Perform breadth-first search and depth-first search on directed as well as undirected graphs
4. Use advanced sorting techniques (heapsort, mergesort, quicksort)
5. Determine the running time of an algorithm in terms of asymptotic notation
6. Solve recurrence relations representing the running time of an algorithm designed using a divide-and-conquer strategy
7. Understand the basic concept of NP-completeness and realize that they may not be able to efficiently solve all problems they encounter in their careers
8. Understand algorithms designed using greedy, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming techniques

### iClicker/REEF polling

To setup the iClicker/REEF polling software on the portable device of your choice:

1. Request: on [REEF Polling by iClicker](http://www.sjsu.edu/at/ec/reef/), fill out a "Student REEF Polling Request Form".
2. Installation: when you receive an email from an SJSU staff member regarding this request, follow the instructions to install the program.
3. Setup: the course name is __FA16-CS146-section7__ or __FA16-CS146-section8__, depending on your section.

## Course Requirements and Assignments

The grade in this course will be weighted as follows:

__Participation:__ although there is no grade incentive, students are expected to attend every class and actively participate.

__Assignments:__ (10%) assignments are assigned roughly every week and will consist of a mix of programming and written problems. Students may discuss approaches to solving problems, but all work that is turned in must be done individually. The two lowest grades will be dropped. Late work is not accepted.

__Exams:__ there will be three in-class exams (20% each) and a comprehensive final exam (30%), to be taken individually. Missed exams cannot be made up except for reasons of illness as certified by a doctor, or documentable extreme emergency. Makeup exams may be oral.

Extra credit problems may be given as part of assignments and exams, the scoring of which may not result in changing the relative weights between assignments and exams.

__Letter grade:__ the final numerical score will translate to the course letter grade according to the following scale:

Percentage|Letter grade
----------|------------
[90-100)|A
[75-90)|B
[60-75)|C
[50-60)|D
[0-50)|F
