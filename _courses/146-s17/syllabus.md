## Course Description

Implementations of advanced tree structures, priority queues, heaps, directed and undirected graphs. Advanced searching and sorting (radix sort, heapsort, mergesort, and quicksort). Design and analysis of data structures and algorithms. Divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming algorithm design techniques.

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLO)

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the implementation of lists, stacks, queues, search trees, heaps, union-find ADT, and graphs and be able to use these data structures in programs they design
2. Prove basic properties of trees and graphs
3. Perform breadth-first search and depth-first search on directed as well as undirected graphs
4. Use advanced sorting techniques (heapsort, mergesort, quicksort)
5. Determine the running time of an algorithm in terms of asymptotic notation
6. Solve recurrence relations representing the running time of an algorithm designed using a divide-and-conquer strategy
7. Understand the basic concept of NP-completeness and realize that they may not be able to efficiently solve all problems they encounter in their careers
8. Understand algorithms designed using greedy, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming techniques

## Course Requirements and Assignments

The grade in this course will be weighted as follows:

__Participation:__ although there is no grade incentive, students are expected to attend every class and actively participate.

__Assignments:__ (20%) assignments are assigned roughly every week and will consist of a mix of programming and written problems. Students may discuss approaches to solving problems, but all work that is turned in must be done individually. The two lowest grades will be dropped. Late work is not accepted for any reason.

__Exams:__ (25% each) there will be two in-class exams. Missed exams can only be rescheduled if there are verifiable emergency circumstances. Makeup exams may be oral.

__Final exam:__ (30%) the final exam is comprehensive. In accordance with University Policy S06-4, final examinations may be rescheduled if there are verifiable emergency circumstances; or if a student has more than two exams scheduled within a 24-hour period. In this case, the student may request an alternative exam date from any one of the instructors at least three weeks prior to the last class meeting. The makeup final exam may be an oral exam.

__Letter grade:__ the final numerical score will translate to the course letter grade according to the following scale:

Percentage|Letter grade
----------|------------
[90-100)|A
[75-90)|B
[60-75)|C
[50-60)|D
[0-50)|F
