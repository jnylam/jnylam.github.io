This assignment contains a single homework problem.

### Problem 1
Find a weighted undirected graph for which the MST-doubling heuristic can generate a tour that is longer than optimal by a factor of at least 5/3. Show both the optimal tour and the MST-doubling tour for your example. (You may use the simplest version of MST-doubling, without shortcutting repeated vertices.)

## Submission

Problem 1 should be submitted on Canvas as a __single PDF file__.

At the top of your file, include:

* your name
* CS 146
* the class section
* Homework [number]

Give credit to those who have helped you by including

* the name of any classmates you collaborated with
* the name of any other person you received help from
* a reference to any other source you may have used to in order to solve problems on this assignment.

All solutions must be written by yourself. Plagiarized work will not receive any credit. Repeated occurrences will result in a report to the department.

Options for making PDFs:

You have the option of handwriting your solutions on paper, scanning them, and converting them to PDF. Please do not send the images.
__If you use a phone or tablet__ to scan your handwritten solutions, [here are some tips on how to this well](http://www.howtogeek.com/209951/the-best-ways-to-scan-a-document-using-your-phone-or-tablet/).

You also have the option of typing your solutions up in your favorite word processor. Export or print your document as a PDF file and submit that. Please do not a submit .docx file.

Finally, you have the option of preparing a professional-looking document using LaTeX. This is what authors use to write textbooks and research papers. If you choose this option, here are some pointers to get you started.
