## Part 1

### Problem 1

Let the universe of discourse be the set of all people associated with Pomona College and consider the following predicates:

$S(x)$: $x$ is a student.  
$F(x)$: $x$ is a faculty member.  
$A(x,y)$: $x$ has asked $y$ a question.

Use quantifiers to express the following statements.

__a)__ Every faculty member has either asked Professor Professorson a question or been asked a question by Professor Professorson.  
__b)__ Some student has not asked any faculty member a question.  
__c)__ There is a faculty member who has asked every __other__ faculty member a question.

### Problem 2

Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false if the universe of discourse is all integers. Provide a brief explanation.

__a)__ $\forall n \exists m (n + m = 0)$  
__b)__ $\exists n \forall m (n < m^2)$  
__c)__ $\exists n \forall m (nm = m)$

### Problem 3

Express the negations of the following propositions in English by turning "for all"s into "there exists" or equivalent phrases. Do not simply use the words "it is not the case that...".

__a)__ Every student in this class likes mathematics.  
__b)__ There is a student in this class who has seen a computer.  
__c)__ There is a student in this class who has been in at least one room of every building on campus.

### Problem 4

Let the universe be the set of vowels. $A = \\{a, e\\}$, $B = \\{i, o\\}$ and $C = \\{a, i, u\\}$. Find

__a)__ $B \times B \times A$  
__b)__ $P(C)$  
__c)__ $A \cap B$  
__d)__ $\overline{(B \cup C)}$  
__e)__ $B - C$  
__f)__ $\varnothing \times A$

### Problem 5

Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false.

__a)__ $x \in \\{x\\}$  
__b)__ $\\{x\\} \subseteq \\{x\\}$  
__c)__ $\\{x\\} \in \\{x\\}$  
__d)__ $\\{x\\} \in \\{\\{x\\}\\}$  
__e)__ $\varnothing \subseteq \\{x\\}$  
__f)__ $\varnothing \in \\{x\\}$

### Problem 6

Determine whether each of the following sets is the power set of a set. Justify your answer.

__a)__ $\varnothing$  
__b)__ $\\{\varnothing, \\{a\\}\\}$  
__c)__ $\\{\varnothing, \\{a\\}, \\{\varnothing, a\\}\\}$  
__d)__ $\\{\varnothing, \\{a\\}, \\{b\\}, \\{a, b\\}\\}$

### Problem 7

Let $A$ be sets. Show that

__a)__ $A - B \subseteq A$  
__b)__ $A \cap (B - A) = \varnothing$  
__c)__ $A \subseteq A \cup B$  
__d)__ $\overline{(A \cap B)} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$  
__e)__ $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$

### Problem 8

Draw the Venn diagrams for each of the following combinations of  $A, B$ and $C$.

__a)__ $A \cap (B \cup C)$  
__b)__ $\overline{A} \cap \overline{B} \cap C$  
__c)__ $(A - B) \cup (A - C) \cup (B - C)$
