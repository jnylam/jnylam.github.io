## Catalog description

Introduction to the study of finite mathematical structures and the ways to build them, count them and analyze them. Topics and examples chosen to relate to concepts of interest in the design and analysis of computer algorithms, including permutations and combinations, graphs and trees and codes. Emphasis on creative problem solving and learning to read and write proofs.

Prerequisite: CSCI 051 (Intro to Computer Science).

## Textbook(s) and other resources

_Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications (fourth edition)_ by Kenneth H. Rosen  
McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-289905-0.  
__This is a 17 year old book and is readily available on the used book market for under ten dollars.__  

_Additional notes may be made available through Piazza._

## Software
If you are feeling motivated and have some spare time to learn a new language, you are encouraged to typeset the solutions to your homework. The standard language for typesetting mathematics is $\LaTeX{}$. We have installed a complete set of applications for working with $\LaTeX{}$ on the lab computers. I recommend you start by trying TeXShop. You can find many tutorials and instructional guides by searching the web.

In addition to solving mathematical problems, we may have a few short programming assignments as part of the course homework. These programing projects will be complete in Java, using Eclipse. This is an environment you should all be familiar with from CSCI&nbsp;051.

## Piazza

We will use Piazza for discussions outside of the classroom. Piazza is a questions-and-answer service designed for the classroom environment. You may post questions publicly using your real name or anonymously (to your classmates), additionally you may post questions privately to your instructors and TAs. In general, the only reason a question should be posted privately is if it concerns your grade or other private matters.

## Grading

Your grade in the course is a weighted average of your grades on homework, quizzes and exams, computed as follows:

- Homework: 15%
- Quizzes: 20%
- Exam 1: 20%
- Exam 2: 20%
- Final Exam: 25%

The conversion from numeric score to letter grades will be determined at the end of the course.

## Homework
There will be a weekly homework assignment, assigned Wednesday morning and due in-class Wednesday of the following week. Poor presentation of your homework may affect your grade. Your solutions are expected to be written neatly on un-torn paper (with four straight sides) and stapled together. Weekly homework will be divided into two parts, where typically each part will be based on one lecture. Each part must be clearly labeled. It is important that you the following information on each page submitted: your full name, my last name, the homework number, the part number. An example of how homework should be submitted will be given in class.

Many of the problems will require you to justify or prove your answers. In these cases, you are expected to write in complete sentences and grammatically correct English.

You are encouraged to work together while solving homework problems, but all submitted solutions should be in your own words.

## Quizzes and Exams

We will have weekly quizzes on Mondays at the beginning of class, covering the material from the previous week's lectures unless otherwise announced. Make up quizzes will only be given for extreme and verifiable circumstances. The two lowest quizzes scores will be dropped.

There will be two in-class exams in addition to a scheduled comprehensive final exam. The dates for the exams are given in the course schedule and are unlikely to change.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty Policy

As a student in this course, you are expected to understand and follow the academic honest policies of Pomona College (or your home campus) and the Department of Computer Science. Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with these policies: [Department of Computer Science Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/academichonesty); [Pomona College Academic Honesty Policy](http://catalog.pomona.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=394). Unless the instructions for an assignment explicitly allow a form of collaboration, assume that the standard academic honesty policies apply. If for any reason you do not understand how the academic policies apply to a particular course or assignment, discuss your concerns with the teaching staff for the course.

Submitted code may be analyzed by automated plagiarism detection software, which detects structural similarities in your code with other students submitted code (this quarter and in the past) and code available on Internet repositories.

All exams will be closed-note, closed-book, closed-computer and individual effort.

If you do not abide by the academic honesty policies, expect severe penalties. The first offense will result in failure in the course and will be reported to the Dean of Students Office. In the event of a second offense, the offense will be reported to the Board of Academic Discipline. For further explanation of the penalties see the academic honest policies linked above.

## Academic Accommodations
If you are seeking academic accommodations, you must contact your home college's disability coordinator to establish accommodations. You should plan to meet with your coordinator to discuss appropriate accommodations and may be asked to provide documentation necessary to verify disabilities. The disability coordinators for the Claremont Colleges are:
<a href='mailto:Jan.Collins-Eaglin@pomona.edu'>Jan Collins-Eaglin (Pomona)</a>,
<a href='mailto:julia.easley@claremontmckenna.edu'>Julia Easley (CMC)</a>,
<a href='mailto:Jill_Hawthorne@pitzer.edu'>Jill Hawthorne (Pitzer)</a>,
<a href='mailto:sdelator@scrippscollege.edu'>Sonia De la Torre Iniguez (Scripps)</a> and
<a href='mailto:hbird@hmc.edu'>Heidi Bird (HMC)</a>.

## Recording
Pomona College prohibits video or voice recording of any lecture or discussion, except in cases that the office of the Dean of Students has granted a student permission according to the Collegeâ€™s Disability Accommodations Policy, or when permission is granted by the instructor. I choose to give permission in this course to be recorded by students. These recordings are for any reasonable use that arises from participation in this course. __These recordings cannot be distributed, transmitted or published in any media or form, nor be used for any commercial purposes.__
