Please do not use paper torn off of a notebook.

## Part 1

### Problem 1
Determine whether $$f$$ is a function...

__a)__ from $$\mathbf{Z}$$ to $$\mathbf{R}$$ if $$f(n) = \pm n$$  
__b)__ from $$\mathbf{Z}$$ to $$\mathbf{Z}$$ if $$f(n) = \sqrt{n^2+1}$$  
__c)__ from $$\mathbf{Z}$$ to $$\mathbf{R}$$ if $$f(n) = \frac{1}{n^2 - 4}$$  

Justify your answers.

### Problem 2
Given an example of a function from $$\mathbf{N}$$ to $$\mathbf{N}$$ such that is

__a)__ one-to-one but not onto.  
__b)__ onto but not one-to-one.  
__c)__ both onto and one-to-one, but different from the identity function.  
__d)__ neither one-to-one nor onto.

Note: the identity function is the function that returns as output its input.

### Problem 3
Let $$f(x) = ax + b$$ and $$g(x) = cx+d$$ where $$a, b, c, d$$ are constants. Determine for which constants $$a, b, c$$ and $$d$$ it is true that $$f \circ g = g \circ f$$. Justify your answer.

## Part 2

### Problem 4
Show that the function $$f:\mathbf{N} \to \mathbf{Z}$$ defined by

$$f(n) = \begin{cases}
-k & \text{if } n \text{ is even, ie, } \exists k\in\mathbb{N} \text{ such that } n = 2k\\
k+1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd, ie, } \exists k\in\mathbb{N} \text{ such that } n = 2k+1\\
\end{cases}$$

is a bijection. In other words, show that $$f$$ is a surjection and an injection.

### Problem 5

For each of the following lists of integers, provide a simple formula that generates the terms of an integer sequence that begins with the given list.

__a)__ 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, ...  
__b)__ 15, 8, 1, -6, -23, -20, -27, ...  
__c)__ 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 23, 30, 38, 47, ...  
__d)__ 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0, ...  

### Problem 6

What are the values of the following sums?

__a)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^5 (k + 1)$$

__b)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{i = 1}^{10} 3$$

__c)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{j\in S} j^2$$ where $$S = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}$$

__d)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{\ell = 0}^8 3 \cdot 2^\ell$$

__e)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{m = 1}^8 2^m$$

__f)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{n = 2}^8 (-3)^n$$

__g)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{t = 0}^8 (2 \cdot 3^t + 3 \cdot 2^t)$$

__h)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{s = 0}^8 (2^{s+1} - 2^s)$$

__i)__ $$\displaystyle\sum_{i = 1}^2 \sum_{j = 1}^3 (i + j)$$
