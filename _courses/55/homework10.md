## Part 1

### Problem 1

Let $$f:\mathbf{N} \rightarrow \mathbf{N}$$ and $$g:\mathbf{N} \rightarrow \mathbf{N}$$ be two functions. Let $$f \sim g$$ if and only if $$f \in \Theta(g)$$. Show that $$\sim$$ is an equivalence relation. (For a reminder of the definition of $$f \in \Theta(g)$$, refer to [Homework 4 Problem 4](homework04.html#problem-4).)

### Problem 2

Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be two sets and define $$A \sim B$$ to mean that there exists a bijection from $$A$$ to $$B$$. Show that $$\sim$$ is an equivalence relation.

### Problem 3
Define $$(a,b) \sim (c,d)$$ where $$a,b,c,d \in \mathbf{Z}$$ <ins>with $$b,d \neq 0$$</ins>, if $$ad = bc$$.

__(a)__ Show that $$\sim$$ is an equivalence relation.  
__(b)__ Describe the equivalence class of $$(4, 6)$$ using set notation.  
__(c)__ Find a system of representatives for the equivalence classes defined by this relation. (Hint: Does the equation $$ad = bc$$ remind you of something from high school algebra?)

### Problem 4

Define $$(a,b) \sim (c,d)$$ where $$a,b,c,d \in \mathbf{Z}$$, if $$ac = bd$$. Show that tilde is __not__ an equivalence relation.

### Problem 5

Define $$(a,b) \sim (c,d)$$ where $$a,b,c,d \in \mathbf{N}$$, if $$a+d = b+c$$.

__(a)__ Show that $$\sim$$ is an equivalence relation.  
__(b)__ Describe the equivalence classes of $$(2, 0)$$ and $$(0, 2)$$ using set notation.  
__(c)__ Find a system of representatives for the equivalence classes defined by this relation.

## Part 2

### Problem 6

If a set $$S$$ with an equivalence relation $$\sim$$ has size $$n$$ and all its equivalence classes have size $$k$$, why must $$k$$ divide $$n$$ evenly? How many equivalence classes does $$S$$ have?

### Problem 7

King Arthur and his 12 knights (K1, K2, ..., K12) need to be seated at a round table.

__(a)__ How many different ways are there to seat these 13 people, if rotations of a seating arrangement are considered distinct?  
__(b)__ Given a particular seating arrangement, how many different seating arrangements are rotations of this seating arrangement? (The original seating arrangement also counts.)  
__(c)__ How many different ways are there to seat these 13 people, if rotations of a seating arrangement are considered equivalent?  

### Problem 8

Consider 12 distinguishable boxes, 3 of which are red, 4 of which are blue, and the rest are green.

__(a)__ How many ways are there to label the 12 boxes from 1 to 12, not taking color into account.  
__(b)__ Given a particular labeling of the boxes, how many ways are there to label the <del>15</del> <ins>12</ins> boxes from 1 to 12, so that the same numbers appear on boxes of the same color as in this particular labeling?  
__(c)__ How many ways are there to label these 12 boxes from 1 to 12, if the boxes can only be distinguished by color?

### Problem 9

King Arthur has 100 Twinkies, 100 pieces of beef jerky and 165 packs of peanuts. He only has one snack a day.

__(a)__ If King Arthur numbers his Twinkies, beef jerky and peanuts separately 1 to 100, 1 to 100 and 1 to 165, in how many different orders can he eat his snacks? (In other words, his snacks are all distinguishable for this question.)  
__(b)__ Given a particular order in which he could eat his snacks, how many total equivalent ways are there to eat the snacks (i.e. if peanut pack number 1 is equivalent to peanut pack number 100)?  
__(c)__ How many actual ways can King Arthur eat his snacks (i.e. not taking into account his numbering)?

### Problem 10

__(a)__ How many words can be made up with the letters from the word $$M_0I_0S_0S_1I_1S_2S_3I_2P_0P_1I_3$$? (Yes, the letters are all distinct!)  
__(b)__ How many words are equivalent to the word $$M_0I_0I_1I_2I_3S_0S_1S_2S_3P_0P_1$$, where two words are considered equivalent if they are the same after removing the indices?  
__(c)__ How many words can be made up with the letters from the word $$MISSISSIPPI$$?
