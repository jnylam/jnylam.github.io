Instructions: please turn in each part stapled separately, labeled with your name, homework number, part and instructor.

## Part 1

### Problem 1

Let $p$, $q$ and $r$ be propositions.

$p$: You get an A on the final exam.  
$q$: You do every exercise in the textbook.  
$r$: You get an A in the class.

Write the following propositions using $p$, $q$ and $r$ and logical operations.

__a)__ To get an A in the class, it is necessary that you get an A on the final.  
__b)__ You get an A on the final, but you don't do every exercise in the textbook; nevertheless, you get an A in the class.  
__c)__ Getting an A on the final and doing every exercise in the book is sufficient to get an A in the class.

### Problem 2

Determine whether each of the following implications is true or false.

__a)__ If 1 + 1 = 2, then 2 + 2 = 5.  
__b)__ If 1 + 1 = 3, then God exists.  
__c)__ If pigs can fly, then 1 + 1 = 2.

### Problem 3

A detective has interviewed four witnesses to a crime. From the stories of the witnesses, the detective has concluded that if the butler is telling the truth, then so is the cook; the cook and the gardener cannot both be telling the truth; the gardener and the handyman are not both lying; and if the handyman is telling the truth, then the cook is lying. For each of the four witnesses, can the detective determine whether that person is telling the truth or lying? Explain your reasoning.

## Part 2

### Problem 4

Prove or disprove that $(\neg p \wedge (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow \neg q$ is a tautology.

### Problem 5

Prove or disprove that $\neg (p \oplus q)$ and $p \leftrightarrow q$ are logically equivalent.

### Problem 6

The following problem involves the logical operation $\mid$, called the Sheffer stroke. The proposition $p \mid q$ is defined to be logically equivalent to $\neg (p \wedge q)$. Using only the Sheffer stroke, find expressions that are logically equivalent to

__a)__ $\neg p$  
__b)__ $p \vee q$  
__c)__ $p \rightarrow q$
