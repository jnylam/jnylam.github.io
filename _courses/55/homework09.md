The following version of the __inclusion-exclusion principle__ may be useful: for any events $$A$$ and $$B$$,

$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$

## Part 1

### Problem 1

Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be events with $$P(A) = 1/3$$ and $$P(B) = 1/4$$ and $$P(A \cup B) = 1/2$$.

__a)__ Find $$P(B \mid A)$$ and $$P(A \mid B)$$.  
__b)__ Are $$A$$ and $$B$$ independent?

### Problem 2

Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be events with $$P(A) = 0.3$$ and $$P(A \cup B) = 0.7$$. Find $$P(B)$$ if:

__a)__ $$A$$ and $$B$$ are disjoint  
__b)__ $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent  
__c)__ $$A$$ is a subset of $$B$$

### Problem 3

A pair of fair dice is thrown. Find the probability that the sum is 10 or greater if:

__a)__ 5 appears on the first die  
__b)__ 5 appears on at least one of the die

### Problem 4

A pair of fair dice is thrown. Given that the two numbers that appear are different, find the probability that:

__a)__ the sum is 6  
__b)__ a 1 appears  
__c)__ the sum is 4 or less

### Problem 5

A class has 12 boys and 4 girls. Suppose three students are selected at random from the class. Find the probability that they are all boys.

### Problem 6

Consider the following events for a family with children:

$$A = \{\text{children of both sexes}\}, \qquad B =\{\text{at most one boy}\}.$$

Assume that the probability that any particular child is a girl is $$\frac{1}{2}$$.

__a)__ Show that $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent events if a family has three children.  
__b)__ Show that $$A$$ and $$B$$ are dependent events if a family has only two children.

### Problem 7

Box $$A$$ contains five red marbles and three blue marbles, and box $$B$$ contains three red and two blue. A marble is drawn at random from each box.

__a)__ Find the probability that both marbles are red.  
__b)__ Find the probability that one is red and one is blue.

### Problem 8

Show that if $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent events, then $$\overline{A}$$ and $$\overline{B}$$ are independent events.

Hint: for any event $$E$$, $$P(\overline{E}) = 1 - P(E)$$.

### Problem 9

Suppose $$P(A) > 0$$. Find $$P(B \mid A)$$ if:

__a)__ $$A$$ is a subset of $$B$$  
__b)__ $$A$$ and $$B$$ are disjoint

## Part 2

### Problem 10

John is a beginning archer. The probability that he hits the target on a single try is $$\frac{1}{4}$$. Given that he shoots 6 times, find the probability that he hits the target

__a)__ exactly twice  
__b)__ more than four times  
__c)__ at least once

### Problem 11

A family has six children. Assume that the probability that any particular child is a boy is $$\frac{1}{2}$$. Find the probability that there are

__a)__ three boys and three girls  
__b)__ fewer boys than girls  

### Problem 12

The probability that Homer bakes a cheese souffl&eacute; without it collapsing is $$\frac{1}{3}$$. (Note: cheese souffl&eacute;s are hard to bake.)

__a)__ If Homer bakes three cheese souffl&eacute;s, what is the probability that at least one of them will not be collapsed?  
__b)__ How many cheese souffl&eacute;s should he bake in order to get at least one  non-collapsed one with a 99.9% probability (or higher)?

### Problem 13

A pair of dice is thrown. Let $$X$$ denote the minimum of the two numbers which occur.

__a)__ Find the probability distribution of $$X$$. In other words, for each of the possible values that $$X$$ can have, find the probability that $$X$$ has that value.  
__b)__ Find the expectation of $$X$$.

### Problem 14

A biased coin is weighted so that $$P(H) = \frac{1}{4}$$ and $$P(T) = \frac{3}{4}$$. The coin is tossed four times. Let $$X$$ denote the longest run of consecutive heads. For example, for the outcome $$HTHH$$, $$X = 2$$.

__a)__ Find the probability distribution of $$X$$.  
__b)__ Find the expectation of $$X$$.

### Problem 15

A fair coin is tossed until a tail occurs or five heads occur. Let $$X$$ denote the number of tosses.

__a)__ Find the probability distribution of $$X$$.  
__b)__ Find the expectation of $$X$$.

### Problem 16

A biased coin is weighted so that $$P(H) = p$$ and $$P(T) = 1-p$$. The coin is tossed $$t$$ times. Let $$X$$ denote the number of heads that appear.

__a)__ Find the probability distribution of $$X$$.  
__b)__ Find the expectation of $$X$$.

### Problem 17

The probability of team Awesome winning any game is $$\frac{1}{2}$$. Suppose Awesome plays team Bingo in a tournament. The first team to win two games in a row or three games wins the tournament. What is the expected number of games in the tournament?

### Problem 18

A state lottery sells 500 tickets for $$\$1$$ each and gives one prize of $$\$100$$, three prizes of $$\$50$$ each, and five prizes of $$\$25$$ each.

__a)__ What is the expected gain of a ticket? (Gain is defined as winnings minus losses.)  
__b)__ What is the state's gain?
